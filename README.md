## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Will my website become GDPR compliant after installing the plugin?
Cookie consent is just one aspect of GDPR. Installing the plugin does not guarantee compliance. You’ll still need to implement other aspects of the GDPR regulation.
###
### Will I have to add all the cookies manually?
Yes, in the free version. The pro version of the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin has a one-click scanner, that’ll scan your website. It’ll also pre-populate cookie information for known cookies.
###
### Do visitors now have to accept/reject cookies in order to use websites?
No. Only the ‘necessary’ cookies will be loaded until the user gives consent.
